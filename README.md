- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @xunix-guy
-  Retired 2015 years now and enjoying it.
-  Worked in IT for many years and still keep up with some hobby projects.
-  Just purhased a very cool Comma Two device that works with openpilot to give drivers a "hands free" cruise controler.
-  It was advertised to work on my 2021 Avalon but does not.  Works great on my 2018 RAV4.
-  Just wanted to review the open source stuff, browse around and better understand the technology and when I might get support for the Avalon.
-  The guide to openpilot port calls for downloading some utililty programs.

-  10/13/2024 - Working with Openpilon on COMMA III on 2021 Highlander (Sunnypilot). Works great.
